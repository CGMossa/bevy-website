Welcome to the Bevy game engine! While Bevy is still very early in development, it's already:

- Rust-first: with all the safety, tooling and power that comes with a modern systems language
- completely free, open source and hackable with an architecture designed for modularity
- powered by an ergonomic and innovative  ECS that makes writing gameplay and engine logic a joy
- support all major desktop platforms with a single code-base, with limited mobile and web support
- high-performance enough that it won't get in your way

This book is designed to provide a more thoughtful, explanation-first to the engine's essential features.
If you just want to try it out hands-on, jump into one of our quick-start guides instead!
